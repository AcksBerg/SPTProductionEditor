This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features a Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but other than that, the construction design is very unique - it is purposefully simple, single-action, and no safety measures except half-cock notch, which makes it be able to withstand horrible operating abuse. Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, the TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances. A special gold edition."

The rifle ensures maximum comfort of the user while aiming and shooting, featuring a quick sighting line recovery, high reliability and ergonomics. The stainless steel barrel has a thread for installing a muzzle brake-compensator or a sound suppressor.

The improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote finish."

        "description": "A .300 Blackout (7.62x35mm) V-Max cartridge with a 7.1 gram lead core polymer tipped expansive bullet with a copper metal jacket, in a brass case. This bullet features a ballistic tip that improves its accuracy and acts as a wedge on the lead core upon impact, allowing the bullet to expand and cause considerable damage on the target. Despite the peculiarity of its design, it is able to pierce basic ballistic body protections. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any problem."

        "description": "The Whisper cartridge is a lightweight, hyper velocity design using an aluminum core and pre-stressed jacket. The aluminum core initiates the expansion slightly after contact, pressing back into the pre-stressed jacket and activating a violent, incapacitating energy transfer. The cartridge is ideal for close fire contacts of unarmored and/or lightly armored targets. Not to be mistaken for .300 Blackout, since Whisper was developed almost 20 years before it."

Despite the bullet's own characteristics when used in a full-power cartridge, these are affected when transferred to an intermediate cartridge, still, the bullet continues to have capabilities to pierce basic ballistic body protections as well as some intermediate models. However, it has a high bounce probability off various surfaces. Its design also allows it to be used in STANAG 5.56x45mm NATO magazines without any issues."
