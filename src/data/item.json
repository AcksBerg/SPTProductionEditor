        "description": "A legendary pistol that has seen numerous military conflicts throughout the years and is still in service in certain regions of the world, in one variation or another. This one is a classic TT-33, the most mass-produced version. It features a Browning short-recoil tilting-barrel system, but other than that, the construction design is very unique - it is purposefully simple, single-action, and no safety measures except half-cock notch, which makes it be able to withstand horrible operating abuse. Thanks to the powerful 7.62x25 cartridge and relatively long barrel, the TT boasts high muzzle velocity, penetration, and impressive accuracy, even over long distances."

The rifle ensures maximum comfort of the user while aiming and shooting, featuring a quick sighting line recovery, high reliability and ergonomics.

One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse.

A better level of protection was required, so the Russian army needed a reliable and functional body armor. In the mid-2000s, the MVD, which was later reorganized into the Russian Guard, received Bagariy bulletproof vests. Bagariy was used both by ordinary soldiers of the internal troops, and in special forces. Actively was used by PMC BEAR as the main heavy body armor."
